# Realtime Voice Preview — `src/` README

This is the **OpenAI Realtime voice layer** for Starchild Live, the user's realtime
voice proxy. It behaves as one natural assistant while using the user's Starchild
context, projects, files, memories, tools, actions, and selected work thread internally.
The UI does not narrate handoffs or implementation details to the user.

> **Provider:** this is **OpenAI** (Realtime API, WebRTC), **not Grok**. The
> URL namespace (`wss://api.openai.com/v1/realtime`) and the audio codec
> conventions belong to OpenAI. Starchild contributes routing and tooling
> only.

|----------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `server.py`                | Tiny backend. Mints ephemeral client secrets and bridges `ask_starchild`.   |
| `index.html`               | Browser WebRTC voice UI (mic, interrupt, function tools, jobs panel).       |
| `parser.js`                | Pure function-call argument parser shared by the browser and Node tests.    |
| `test_function_calls.js`   | Node unit tests for the parser (**59** cases).                              |
| `test_background_jobs.py`  | Python unit tests for `/agent_jobs` lifecycle and serialization (**16**).   |
| `smoke.py`                 | CLI WebSocket smoke: text in → audio out → `hello.wav` (no browser needed).  |

## 1. Prerequisites (one-time)

1. **OpenAI API key** with Realtime-model access and an active billing/credit
   balance on that project.
   * Issue: `https://platform.openai.com/api-keys` → *Create new secret key*.
   * Top up the same project at *Billing*; Realtime is paid per audio-second,
     so a non-zero credit balance is required to hear any output.
   * The same project must have access to a Realtime model (default:
     `gpt-realtime-2.1`).
   * **Limit the scope.** Prefer a project-scoped key with only `api` access;
     do not grant `org:read` or write access to other products. Never paste
     the key into chat, logs, or browser code.

2. **Node.js ≥ 18** (for the parser test suite).

3. *(Optional)* A reachable Starchild Agent runtime at `STARCHILD_RUNTIME_URL`
   (default `http://127.0.0.1:8000`). Without it, `ask_starchild` will not be
   able to reach your agent; the realtime model will still speak, but every
   tool call will error.

---

## 2. Configure the key (securely)

Use the skill's `request_env_input` mechanism. It stores
`OPENAI_REALTIME_API_KEY` securely in the workspace environment without putting the
value in chat history. Never paste the key into chat, source files, commands, or logs.

The server keeps the long-lived key server-side. The browser receives only ephemeral
per-session `client_secret` values.

---

## 3. Install / start / test

```bash
# From the project root (parent of src/):
python3 skills/realtime-voice-preview/scripts/setup.py
python3 output/projects/realtime-voice-preview/src/server.py
curl -sS http://127.0.0.1:8765/health

node output/projects/realtime-voice-preview/src/test_function_calls.js
python3 output/projects/realtime-voice-preview/src/test_background_jobs.py
python3 output/projects/realtime-voice-preview/src/smoke.py
```

Serve the demo with the Preview tool:

| Field     | Value                                          |
|-----------|------------------------------------------------|
| `title`   | `OpenAI Realtime Voice Demo`                   |
| `dir`     | `output/projects/realtime-voice-preview/src`   |
| `command` | `python3 server.py`                            |
| `port`    | `8765`                                         |

Keep `title` constant across restarts — the Preview ID is derived from the
title slug; renaming it silently mints a new ID and breaks your saved URL.
Branding changes belong in the HTML `<title>` and on-page copy only.

---

## 4. Open in a separate full-screen browser tab

Microphone permission can be blocked or unreliable inside an embedded Preview iframe.
Always open the Preview URL in its **own browser tab** (use the Preview panel's
open-in-new-tab or pop-out action) and preferably test **full-screen**.

The first time the page loads, the browser prompts for microphone access.
Click **Allow**. The permission is bound to the origin (host + port), not the
tab, so reloading does not re-prompt — but a fresh Preview ID (after a rename
of the serve `title`) counts as a new origin.

Once connected:

* Speak naturally — interrupt whenever you want.
* Trigger tools: *"ask Starchild about my account"* makes Realtime emit
  `ask_starchild`, which is forwarded to the Starchild runtime and spoken
  back. Pick the thread route in **Agent Settings**:

  1. **Temporary — do not enter an existing thread** *(default)*. No read or
     write to any work thread. Rolling transcript is kept in the browser for
     follow-ups.
  2. **Persistent voice thread** — dedicated voice-only context.
  3. **Recent work threads** (titled, newest first) — picks and continues an
     existing thread by title; the underlying ID is hidden from the user.

## 5. Customisation knobs

| Env var                   | Default                   | Purpose                                  |
|---------------------------|---------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| `STARCHILD_RUNTIME_URL`   | `http://127.0.0.1:8000`   | Starchild Agent runtime base.            |
| `REALTIME_MODEL`          | `gpt-realtime-2.1`        | Realtime model id.                       |
| `REALTIME_VOICE`          | `marin`                   | Voice preset.                            |
| `REALTIME_DEMO_PORT`      | `8765`                    | HTTP port for the demo server.           |
| `OPENAI_REALTIME_API_KEY` | *none*                    | Long-lived OpenAI key (server-side).     |

Key lookup order: (1) shell environment, (2) `<project-root>/.env`,
(3) `cwd/.env`.

## 6. Endpoints exposed by `server.py`

| Method         | Path                              | Purpose                                                       |
|----------------|-----------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|
| `GET`          | `/`                               | Serves `index.html`.                                          |
| `GET`          | `/health`                         | Liveness + current model/voice + bridge config.               |
| `GET`          | `/token`                          | Ephemeral client secret (legacy fallback).                    |
| `POST`         | `/session`                        | Unified WebRTC: SDP offer → SDP answer (base64-wrapped).      |
| `GET`          | `/bridge_config`                  | Current bridge config + runtime model list.                   |
| `POST`         | `/bridge_config`                  | Save the selected `route` (Temporary / Persistent / titled).  |
| `GET`          | `/bridge_threads?agent_id=...`    | Titled work-thread catalog.                                   |
| `POST`         | `/agent_bridge`                   | Dispatch `ask_starchild` to the Starchild runtime.            |
| `GET`          | `/agent_jobs`                     | Active/pending jobs (recovery after reload).                 |
| `GET`          | `/agent_jobs?run_id=...`          | Poll a single job.                                            |
| `POST`         | `/agent_jobs/cancel`              | Cooperative cancellation.                                     |

---

## 7. Temporary vs Persistent vs titled thread (titled-thread mode)

| Mode               | Reads history | Writes           | `is_temporary` | Context block sent |
|--------------------|---------------|------------------|----------------|---------------------|
| Temporary (default)| no            | no               | `true`         | rolling ~6 turns    |
| Persistent         | yes (voice)   | yes (voice only) | `false`        | none                |
| Selected titled    | yes (that thread) | yes (that thread) | `false`    | none                |

Why **Temporary** is the default: most voice sessions are throwaway
questions, so opting into a real work thread should be deliberate. Why
**titled** rather than ID-only: a raw thread id is meaningless to a user;
the dropdown shows titles with message-count/activity as secondary text.

---

## 8. Background-job lifecycle

* `ask_starchild(question, execution_mode?)` with `auto|wait|background`.
* `wait` is bounded by a safe timeout; if it has not finished, the server
  auto-promotes to HTTP 202 with a resumable `run_id`.
* `background` returns 202 immediately.
* Client persists pending jobs + a bounded delivered-ID set in
  `localStorage`, polls `/agent_jobs?run_id=...` every ~2 s, and recovers
  active jobs after reload.
* Verified terminal results are injected into Realtime **once** as a new
  conversation message (not a second `function_call_output`).
* Cancellation is cooperative: `cancel_requested` is not terminal until the
  worker reports it.

## 9. Architecture (target product)

```
Browser mic ──WebRTC──► OpenAI Realtime  (VAD / turn / interrupt / speech)
                              │
                              ├─ function tools (now)
                              │      └─ ask_starchild → Starchild Agent bridge
                              │
                              └─ remote MCP tools (later)
                                     └─ public MCP endpoint of the agent
```

* **Phase 1 (current):** function-calling bridge — full control, easy
  approvals, private systems stay private.
* **Phase 2 (later):** attach `{type:"mcp", server_url, allowed_tools,
  require_approval}` on the session so OpenAI calls Starchild MCP directly.

---

## 10. Security checklist

* `.env` exists, is git-ignored, holds **only** the long-lived OpenAI key.
* The Preview tab is opened in its **own** browser window — never inside the
  embedded Preview iframe, which cannot capture the microphone.
* Rotate the OpenAI key by re-issuing under the same project; never paste
  the new value in chat.
* Per-call `thread_id` overrides are deliberately ignored at `/agent_bridge`;
  only the saved `route` is honoured.
* SDP answers are base64-wrapped inside JSON to survive the Preview proxy.

## 11. Troubleshooting (quick map)

| Symptom                                                  | Check                                                                          |
|----------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `OPENAI_REALTIME_API_KEY missing`                         | Run `scripts/setup.py`; if still missing, your `.env` is unreadable.          |
| 401 from OpenAI                                          | Project lacks Realtime access, or zero credit balance.                        |
| Voice quiet / no sound                                   | Browser mic permission; full-screen tab (not Preview iframe).                 |
| `ask_starchild` returns connection refused                | `STARCHILD_RUNTIME_URL`; `curl http://127.0.0.1:8000/health`.                 |
| `Unexpected token '<'` after ~30 s                        | Server must auto-promote `wait` to `run_id`; client must validate text first. |
| Voice cuts off / query interrupted                        | Check thread serialization and the completed-result cache.                      |
| Job result not spoken after reload                        | Confirm run is still pending, data channel open, delivered-ID set excludes it. |
| Cancel stuck at `cancel_requested`                        | Cooperative cancellation; wait for the worker to confirm.                      |
