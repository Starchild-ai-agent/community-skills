# Meta DEX Aggregator — Multi-Source Quote Comparison with Safety Layer

Aggregator of aggregators. Queries 5 DEX aggregators in parallel, ranks by
gas-adjusted net output, and runs safety checks before execution.

## Safety Features

1. **Price Impact** — Fetches fair market price from DefiLlama coins API
   (+ DexScreener fallback), compares vs quote output.
   Thresholds: 3% warning, 5% high, 10% critical (blocks swap).
2. **Gas-Adjusted Ranking** — `netOut = amountUsd - gasUsd`. Best route ≠ most tokens.
3. **MEV Protection Flags** — CowSwap and 0x Gasless are flagged `isMEVSafe`.
   Recommends MEV-safe route when within 0.5% of best price.
4. **Slippage Warnings** — Sandwich risk >1%, stablecoin pairs >0.05%, too-low revert risk.
5. **Outlier Detection** — Quotes >5% worse than best are flagged as outliers.

## Aggregators

| Adapter | API Key | Status |
|---------|---------|--------|
| ParaSwap | None needed | ✅ |
| Odos | None needed | ✅ |
| KyberSwap | None needed | ✅ |
| 1inch | Native tool (platform-proxied) | ✅ |
| Matcha/0x | `OX_API_KEY` in .env | ✅ |

## Workflow: Quote with Safety Check

**Step 1 & 2 run in PARALLEL (no dependency between them):**

```bash
# 1. Get 4 aggregator quotes (ParaSwap, Odos, KyberSwap, Matcha/0x + safety)
cd skills/meta-dex-aggregator/scripts && \
  python3 meta_dex.py quote --chain base --from ETH --to USDC --amount 0.5 --slippage 0.5
```

```
# 2. Get 1inch quote via native tool (proxied, no API key needed)
oneinch_quote(chain="base", src="<from_addr>", dst="<to_addr>", amount="<amount_in_wei>")
# Returns: { "dstAmount": "<raw_amount>" }
# Convert: dstAmount / 10^decimals = human amount
```

**Step 3 — Merge & present:**
- Script returns quotes with: `aggregator`, `amountOutHuman`, `amountUsd`, `gasUsd`, `netOut`, `vsbestPct`
- 1inch native tool returns `dstAmount` (raw wei) — convert to human amount using token decimals
- Insert 1inch into the ranked table, recalculate `vsbestPct` if 1inch is the new winner
- The script's `safety` block (priceImpact, slippageWarnings, recommendation) applies to all quotes
- If `priceImpact.severity` is "high"/"critical" — WARN and **block the swap**
- Execute via `oneinch_swap` if 1inch wins, or `wallet_transfer` with tx data for others

## Workflow: Execute Swap

```bash
# 1. Get wallet address
wallet_info()

# 2. Get swap tx data
cd skills/meta-dex-aggregator/scripts && \
  python3 meta_dex.py swap --chain base --from ETH --to USDC --amount 0.5 \
    --aggregator odos --wallet 0x... --slippage 0.5

# 3. For ERC-20 tokens: check + set approval
oneinch_check_allowance(chain, token) → oneinch_approve(chain, token) if needed

# 4. Execute via wallet_transfer using the tx data from step 2
wallet_transfer(to=tx.to, amount=tx.value, data=tx.data, chain_id=chainId)
```

## Cross-Chain Swaps

When src_chain ≠ dst_chain, use `xquote` to compare cross-chain routes:

```bash
python3 skills/meta-dex-aggregator/scripts/meta_dex.py xquote \
  --src-chain arbitrum --dst-chain polygon \
  --from ETH --to USDC --amount 0.5 \
  --wallet $WALLET --slippage 3
```

**Cross-chain sources:**
- **LI.FI** — aggregates 20+ bridges (Relay, Stargate, Across, Hop, etc.). Returns ready-to-sign tx data. Execute via `wallet_transfer(to, amount=value, data, chain_id, gas_limit)`. Track status with `curl -s "https://li.quest/v1/status?txHash={hash}&fromChain={src_id}&toChain={dst_id}"`.
- **1inch Fusion+** — intent-based atomic swaps (gasless, resolver handles both chains). The script returns a `needsToolCall: true` marker. Complete with `oneinch_cross_chain_quote` tool for the quote, then `oneinch_cross_chain_swap` for execution.

**Cross-chain workflow:**
1. Run `xquote` → get LI.FI routes + 1inch Fusion+ marker
2. Call `oneinch_cross_chain_quote` tool to fill in the 1inch quote
3. Compare all routes: output amount, total fees (gas + bridge + protocol), estimated time
4. Present table to user with clear winner
5. For execution: LI.FI routes → `wallet_transfer` with tx data; 1inch → `oneinch_cross_chain_swap`
6. Cross-chain is non-atomic — track status and confirm delivery on destination chain

**Safety notes for cross-chain:**
- Default slippage 3% (bridges need more than same-chain swaps)
- Always show estimated delivery time (4s to 10min depending on bridge)
- Always show fee breakdown (gas + bridge fees + protocol fees)
- After execution, track until funds arrive on destination chain
- LI.FI `DONE/PARTIAL` means bridge delivered but not the final token — may need a manual swap

## Token Resolution — Smart Confirmation

Token resolution is tiered to avoid bothering the user for obvious tokens
while protecting against picking the wrong contract for ambiguous ones.

### Confidence levels returned by `resolve_token`:

| Confidence | Meaning | Action |
|-----------|---------|--------|
| `trusted` | Hardcoded canonical address (USDC, WETH, WBTC, etc.) | ✅ Auto-use, no confirmation |
| `exact` | User provided a 0x address directly | ✅ Auto-use, no confirmation |
| `single` | Only one token matches the symbol on this chain | ✅ Auto-use, no confirmation |
| `high` | Multiple matches but top has >10x volume of runner-up | ✅ Auto-use, no confirmation |
| `ambiguous` | Multiple plausible matches, none dominant | ⚠️ **MUST confirm with user** |

### When `confidence == "ambiguous"`:

The result includes a `candidates` list. Present them to the user:

```
I found multiple tokens matching "XYZ" on Arbitrum:

1. XYZ (XYZ Protocol) — 0x1234...5678 — $2.3M 24h vol
2. XYZ (XYZ Finance) — 0xabcd...ef01 — $180K 24h vol
3. XYZ (Old XYZ) — 0x9876...5432 — $12K 24h vol

Which one did you mean? (or paste the contract address directly)
```

Once the user picks, re-call with the address directly to bypass resolution.

### Trusted token coverage:

Ethereum, Arbitrum, Base, Optimism, Polygon, BSC, Avalanche, Gnosis —
all major tokens (WETH, USDC, USDT, DAI, WBTC, LINK, UNI, AAVE, stETH,
plus chain-specific tokens like ARB, OP, AERO, GMX, etc.)

## Chain Support

ethereum, bsc, polygon, optimism, arbitrum, avalanche, gnosis, fantom,
zksync, base, linea, scroll, sonic, unichain

## Safety Response Format

The `quote` command returns a `safety` block:
```json
{
  "recommendation": "✅ All checks passed. Best route looks safe.",
  "priceImpact": {"value": 0.02, "severity": "ok"},
  "slippageWarnings": [],
  "marketPrices": {"gas_token_price": 2170, "from_token_price": 2170, "to_token_price": 1.0}
}
```

Severity levels: `ok` | `warning` (3%) | `high` (5%) | `critical` (10%)

**CRITICAL: If severity is "high" or "critical", BLOCK the swap and warn the user explicitly.**
